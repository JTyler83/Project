    <div class="about-container">Welcome to WhatsUp Girl Gang! My name is Jennifer Corniel. I've created this brand to
        encompass a feeling inspired by my
        own toddler, Olivia. Its not just a brand, its a mood!!

                Olivia was born with some major heart
                defects that have required a series of 3 open heart surgeries in just the few
                years she has been here. Her strength and determination has shined strong right out of the gate!! She
                was just a
                few
                days old and awaiting her first surgery. A nurse came in and said, "This girl has got a temper!" We both
                laughed
                and she
                continued, " she is a fighter and that is what it takes for something like this." I couldn't imagine
                they could
                tell her
                temperment so soon. Than again, they see babies like mine all of the time so she must be right.

                She was! Olivia has been bursting with
                determination and a strong will ever since. Overcoming all that stands in her way
                with such courage and some major humor to go with it. That is how "WhatsUp Girl Gang" was born. She came
                in to
                my room,
                not even 2 years old to let me know she was dressed like a "WhatsUp Girl". This continued to describe
                many
                outfits,
                songs and entertainment for her. I thought, I need to make some shirts for the "WhatsUp Girl" with
                Olivia's
                funny catch
                phrases to go with it.

                I am so excited to
                share this organic idea inspired by the strongest girl I know with all of you. The first few years of
                your childs life are something of magic. What they say and how they view this world is hilariously
                entertaining
                and so
                special. I wanted to capture that for all. We are born with such a beautiful confidence and surety of
                knowing
                who we
                are. Cheers to the "WhatsUp Girl" in all of us and may she live on forever!

            Our family is growing. Olivia has a
            beautiful baby sister now, who seems to have her own sweet fierceness! Her name is
            Vanessa and she is 5 months old. We look forward to our journey and love sharing our products that are
            inspired
            with
            love and hope.
